# Learning @Bean annotation
* We use @Bean if the implementing classes are built in which we can't modify.
* But we can use @Bean for user defined classes also.
* Saw how to resolve a conflict if we have more than 1 method returning same type of data
* But if there is only one method ,it will always return the same value for different objects
* No need to specify the same variable name as method name if 1 method is there.
